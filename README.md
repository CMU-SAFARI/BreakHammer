## Installation Guide:

### Prerequisites:
- Git
- g++ with c++20 capabilities (g++-10 or above recommended)
- Python3 (3.10 or above recommended)
- Podman (Optional)
  - We have tested Podman 4.5.1 on Ubuntu 22.04.1
 
### Installation steps:

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:kirbyydoge/breakhammer.git`
3. Install python dependencies, build Ramulator2, and download traces with `./run_simple_test.sh`

## Example Use

1. Run Ramulator2 simulations `./run_with_slurm.sh` (If you do not have slurm use `./run_with_personalcomputer.sh` instead)
2. Wait for the simulations to finish. You can use `./check_run_status.sh` to track run status (this script also creates intermediate scripts that can restart failed runs)
3. Parse simulation results and collects statistics with `./parse_results.sh`
4. Generate figures with `./plot_all.sh`
